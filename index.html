	<h1>Designer with a business mentality</h1>
	<br />
	<p><u>The Road of Art</u><br />
	I spent quit a lot of time on toys that required me to build - Legos, Rail Roads, Jigsaw Puzzle.<br />
	But my passion for design started when my parents liked a comic I drew when I was 12 years old.<br />
	"It's good, you can keep doing it."<br />
	I started to focus in art since junior high and first majored media in college.<br />
	Even though I was sidetracked to do business, I still did media related work as a freelancer.<br />
	I think the thing that kept me going is that I like to see things I design come to life - I have a genuine good feeling about it.</p>
	<br />
	<p><u>The Road of Working Value</u><br />
	"Pick the hard road, and pick the heavy job."<br />
	I didn't realize what it meant when I first saw it about 6 years old, it was written on 2 stone colums on top of a mountain in Taiwan.<br />
	Later I understood what it meant, I treated working as an experience-gainer opposed to an effort-giver. I have taken part-time jobs in supermarket, restaurant, language school, coffee shop and bar. Although I didn't find everything I did profoundly enjoyable. It helped me discover myself and first-hand knowledge of how these businesses operate.</p>
	<br />
	<p><u>The Road on Design and Business</u><br />
	I spent most of my day time working for auto parts wholesale warehouse, and was proud to make good relationship and service to the shops. At one point, I was managing a 15 people branch.<br />
	However, the more I know about wholesale the more I know that's not the path I want to go.<br />
	On the side, I had been doing animation freelance and a bit of websites. As opposed to wholesale, the more I do, the more I know that I like to code.<br />
	So back in 2014, I went back to school to start my CS major, it's a long road, but I have the finance and time to back it up.<br />
	In 2015, after several classes, one of my friend told me about a code camp called Startup Institute, and I thought "I have been working in small businesses, tried to start some gigs, and already a couple years in coding, this is the perfect oppurtuinity to push me into the market."<br />
	So, I skipped my class in college of Spring 2016 and joined Startup Institute, I enjoyed most of it, after all, it provided me the key skill for the market instead of some generic classes my college required me to take.<br />
	I am now ready to join the market with a decent profolio, please check my contact & portfolio page for more reference.</p>

<!-- Personal life experience -->
<div class="center" id="LE">
	<h1>Life is about building assets</h1>
	<br />
	<p><u>Landlordship</u><br />
	Back in the college, I stumbled upon the famous book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" and was very motivaed by it.<br />
	So when I bought my first house back in 2007, I was getting ready to create some passive income - I bought a oversized house and started renting out spare rooms.<br />
	All was good, I have managed my budget, and money flowed in. However, things started to go down as I moved in with my wife, who lives about 45 minutes away.<br />
	I found managing the house difficult, I had to spend 2 hours just for showing and paperwork signing, even if I want to communicate over the internet, people can be unresponsive - that when I know I need to see things in big pictures.<br />
	There was a lot to learn about laws and budgeting and I loved it. Now I also know how to better manage my time.</p>
	<br />
	<p><u>Remodeling</u><br />
	As a hosue owner, like some others, I like DIY house improvement.<br />
	I played with electricity, 2x4 & drywalls, custom rack, faucets, and lighting.<br />
	I love putting LED behind furnitures, the dimming light putting a shade on the wall is just so cool.<br />
	<br />
	<p><u>Entertainment</u><br />
	I like variety and adventure when it comes to entertainment, I hardly keep the same activity going for too long. Except for seasonal sport like snowboarding or biking.<br />
	For example, I finish one video game and leave the console for months, because I want to be thorough for the gaming experience and not spending too much time on it.<br />
	I lost more than 30 lbs during my body trainning, I went to gyms religiously and always reach the goals in my diet.<br />
	My goal is to do enough to see there are accomplishments, but not to be attached too much to a point that I am unhealthy or rule out other activities.</p>
